\title{Install Python environment for cfomics}
\usage{
cf_install_python_env(
  method = c("unified", "unified_full", "dowhy", "ganite", "econml", "pyro", "all"),
  python_version = "3.11",
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{The environment to install:
\itemize{
  \item "unified": Recommended. Contains DoWhy and EconML (no deep learning)
  \item "unified_full": Full environment with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pyro
  \item "dowhy", "ganite", "econml", "pyro": Method-specific environments
  \item "all": Install all method-specific environments (legacy)
}}

\item{python_version}{The Python version to use (default "3.11")}

\item{force}{Logical, whether to recreate the environment if it exists}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns TRUE on success
}
\description{
Creates conda environments with the required Python packages for
causal inference methods. The "unified" environment is recommended
as it contains dependencies for most methods.

\dontrun{
cf_install_python_env("unified")       # Recommended
cf_install_python_env("unified_full")  # With deep learning
cf_install_python_env("dowhy")         # DoWhy only
