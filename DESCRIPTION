Description: A unified interface for counterfactual causal inference methods
    designed for omics data analysis. Supports SummarizedExperiment and
    MultiAssayExperiment data structures from Bioconductor. Implements
    multiple causal inference backends including DoWhy-GCM, GANITE,
    DRLearner, CAVAE (Python-based), and GRF, IPW, G-formula (R-native).
    Provides tools for individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation,
    average treatment effect (ATE) computation, and counterfactual outcome
    prediction in high-dimensional biological data.
