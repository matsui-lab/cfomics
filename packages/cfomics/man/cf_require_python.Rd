\title{Require Python for a Method}
\usage{
cf_require_python(
  method = c("dowhy_gcm", "drlearner", "ganite", "cavae"),
  initialize = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Character string specifying the method that requires Python.
One of: \code{"dowhy_gcm"}, \code{"drlearner"}, \code{"ganite"},
\code{"cavae"}.}

\item{initialize}{Logical indicating whether to attempt Python initialization
if not already initialized. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if Python is available. Throws an
  error if Python or required packages are not available.
}
\description{
Ensures that Python and required packages are available for a specific
cfomics method. If not available, raises an informative error with
instructions for setup.
}
\details{
Unlike \code{\link{cf_has_python}}, this function may initialize Python
if it hasn't been initialized yet and an appropriate environment can be
found.


This function is called internally by Python-based method implementations
(e.g., \code{cf_fit_dowhy_gcm}) to ensure the environment is properly
configured before attempting to run Python code.

The function checks:
\enumerate{
  \item Whether Python is available
  \item Whether the required Python package for the method is installed
}

If checks fail, an error is raised with:
\itemize{
  \item A clear description of what's missing
  \item Instructions on how to set up the environment
  \item A suggestion to run \code{cf_check_env()} for diagnostics
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Called internally by cf_fit when method = "dowhy_gcm"
cf_require_python("dowhy_gcm")

# After this call, Python is guaranteed to be available
# and dowhy package can be imported
}
}
