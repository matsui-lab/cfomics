\usage{
cf_overlap_check(data, treatment, covariates, method = c("logistic"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame or SummarizedExperiment}

\item{treatment}{Name of treatment variable}

\item{covariates}{Names of covariates for propensity score model}

\description{
Examines the distribution of propensity scores to assess whether the
positivity assumption holds (sufficient overlap between treatment groups).
