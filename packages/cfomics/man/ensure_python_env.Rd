\title{Ensure Python environment is available}
\usage{
ensure_python_env()
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE on success
}
\description{
This function checks that a Python environment is available for use.
cfomics does NOT manage Python environments - users must prepare their own
conda/mamba/virtualenv environment with the required dependencies.
}
\details{
The function respects the following priority:
1. If Python is already initialized (e.g., via use_condaenv()), use it
2. If RETICULATE_PYTHON is set, use that Python
3. Otherwise, error with instructions
}
