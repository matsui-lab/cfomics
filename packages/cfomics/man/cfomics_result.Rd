\title{Result Contract: cfomics_result Object Structure}
\description{
This file documents the formal structure (contract) for \code{cfomics_result}
objects returned by \code{\link{cf_fit}}. All causal inference methods in
cfomics MUST return objects conforming to this structure.
}
\section{Object Structure}{


A \code{cfomics_result} object is a list with the following components:

\describe{
  \item{method}{Character string identifying the method used (e.g., "grf",
    "dowhy_gcm").}
  \item{fit}{Method-specific fitted model object. Structure varies by method.}
  \item{meta}{Metadata list (see Meta Structure below).}
}
}

\section{Meta Structure}{


The \code{meta} component is a list containing:

\describe{
  \item{formula}{The formula used for fitting.}
  \item{n}{Integer, number of observations.}
  \item{p}{Integer, number of covariates.}
  \item{outcome_name}{Character, name of the outcome variable.}
  \item{treatment_name}{Character, name of the treatment variable.}
  \item{covariate_names}{Character vector of covariate names.}
  \item{estimand}{Character, the causal estimand being estimated (see Estimands).}
  \item{target_population}{Character, the target population ("all", "treated",
    or "control").}
  \item{dag_spec}{List of edge pairs if a DAG was provided, NULL otherwise.}
  \item{bootstrap}{Logical, whether bootstrap was used.}
  \item{random_state}{Integer, the random seed used.}
  \item{preprocess}{List describing preprocessing steps applied.}
  \item{software_versions}{List of R and Python package versions used.}
}
}

\section{Fit Structure (res component)}{


The \code{fit$res} component contains the actual results and MUST include:

\describe{
  \item{ite}{Numeric vector of Individual Treatment Effects. Length equals n.}
  \item{ate}{Numeric scalar, Average Treatment Effect.}
  \item{y0_hat}{Numeric vector of counterfactual outcomes under no treatment.}
  \item{y1_hat}{Numeric vector of counterfactual outcomes under treatment.}
  \item{summary}{List containing summary statistics (see Summary Structure).}
}
}

\section{Summary Structure}{


The \code{fit$res$summary} list MUST contain:

\describe{
  \item{ate}{Numeric, point estimate of ATE.}
  \item{ate_ci_lower}{Numeric, lower bound of 95\% CI for ATE.}
  \item{ate_ci_upper}{Numeric, upper bound of 95\% CI for ATE.}
  \item{ite_mean}{Numeric, mean of ITEs.}
  \item{ite_std}{Numeric, standard deviation of ITEs.}
  \item{ite_quantiles}{List with q05, q50, q95 quantiles of ITEs.}
}
}

\section{Estimands}{


cfomics supports the following causal estimands:

\describe{
  \item{ATE (Average Treatment Effect)}{
    \eqn{E[Y(1) - Y(0)]}
    The expected difference in outcomes between treatment and control
    across the entire population.
  }
  \item{ATT (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated)}{
    \eqn{E[Y(1) - Y(0) | T=1]}
    The expected effect for those who actually received treatment.
  }
  \item{ATC (Average Treatment Effect on the Control)}{
    \eqn{E[Y(1) - Y(0) | T=0]}
    The expected effect for those who did not receive treatment.
  }
  \item{ITE (Individual Treatment Effect)}{
    \eqn{Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)}
    The treatment effect for individual i.
  }
  \item{CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect)}{
    \eqn{E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X=x]}
    The expected effect conditional on covariates.
  }
}
}

\section{Causal Assumptions}{


All methods in cfomics rely on the following fundamental assumptions:

\describe{
  \item{SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)}{
    No interference between units and no hidden variations of treatment.
  }
  \item{Ignorability (Conditional Independence)}{
    \eqn{(Y(0), Y(1)) \perp T | X}
    Treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes given covariates.
  }
  \item{Positivity (Overlap)}{
    \eqn{0 < P(T=1|X) < 1}
    Every unit has a positive probability of receiving either treatment.
  }
}

Use \code{\link{cf_balance_check}} and \code{\link{cf_overlap_check}} to
assess these assumptions in your data.
}

\section{S3 Methods}{


Objects of class \code{cfomics_result} support the following S3 methods:

\describe{
  \item{\code{predict(object, type, ...)}}{Extract predictions (ate, ite, y0, y1).}
  \item{\code{summary(object, ...)}}{Display summary with CIs.}
  \item{\code{print(object, ...)}}{Print overview of results.}
  \item{\code{plot(object, ...)}}{Visualize treatment effects.}
}
}

\section{Class Hierarchy}{


Objects have dual classes: \code{c("cf_model", "cfomics_result")}.
This allows for both generic and specific method dispatch.
